So as we talked about the evolution of internet we witnessed a number of
different distinct phases. Among these phases is connectivity starting int he
late 60's and that's when, you know, we were just starting to get disparate
cmputing system connected together just for the basic sharing of information.
From there it kind of transitionned into a system of exchange with the network
economy, where thing became more transactional. We saw the rise of e-commerce
and then, more recently we've seen the collaborative experience in the internet
where getting the right people doing the right thing together at the right
time, you know, all empowered and facilate by the internet, but most recent is
the current tranistion that's taking place with the internet of everything, the
IOE. And so, Rodrigo, can you tell me what is the IOE ?

So, I'm just gonna give you an exemple :
Let's say you need to buy a pair of shoes for someone that you love and so you
get on your phone and you give im a call and of course this is a video call.
This is not the 1960's anymore. So you get on your phone, you place the video
call and you have a little conversation trying to learn a litle more about what
kind of shoes the person like right ? So, once you know that you get in your
car and you realize that the mall close-by hase the perfect store for you to
buy that pair of shoes. So you push the address of the mall into your GPS and
you just go to that mall. Your car ,because of the GPS, it knows where it-s
close to the mall and when it approches the mall it is able to talk to the
computer at the mall handling the parking lot and ask for a parking spot. When
comming in a mall, I need a parking spot
