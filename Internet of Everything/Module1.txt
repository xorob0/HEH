Hello, this is Jerremy creech, I am a manager at Cisco's system.
I am working inside the product developpement for the Cisco's networking
accademy program And you are listening to the first of a serie of podcast
introducing the internet of everithing, or, as we call it, the IOE.
This podcast serie is a companion to the Cisco's networking academy
introduction to the IOE course and today we will be answering the question
"What is the IOE".

My guest today are Dane Albargetty, you might know him from danecourses.com. He
is also a cheap contributor inside the content developpement for the networking
accademy program ad also joining us is Rodrigo odriono Technologist
extraordinary and also key contributor to a lot of the activity developpement
and content developpement inside of the networking academy program as well.
And then also joining us from the Cartel of northies is Bernadette O'Brian,
Networking academy instructor and also contributor to networking academy
developpement and the content we create.
And the last and certenely not least is BOB Fishon also a networking academy
instrucor, award winning instructor in canada. Also a Cisco Press author.

So as we talked about the evolution of internet we witnessed a number of
different distinct phases. Among these phases is connectivity starting int he
late 60's and that's when, you know, we were just starting to get disparate
cmputing system connected together just for the basic sharing of information.
From there it kind of transitionned into a system of exchange with the network
economy, where thing became more transactional. We saw the rise of e-commerce
and then, more recently we've seen the collaborative experience in the internet
where getting the right people doing the right thing together at the right
time, you know, all empowered and facilate by the internet, but most recent is
the current tranistion that's taking place with the internet of everything, the
IOE. And so, Rodrigo, can you tell me what is the IOE ?

So, I'm just gonna give you an exemple :
Let's say you need to buy a pair of shoes for someone that you love and so you
get on your phone and you give im a call and of course this is a video call.
This is not the 1960's anymore. So you get on your phone, you place the video
call and you have a little conversation trying to learn a litle more about what
kind of shoes the person like right ? So, once you know that you get in your
car and you realize that the mall close-by hase the perfect store for you to
buy that pair of shoes. So you push the address of the mall into your GPS and
you just go to that mall. Your car ,because of the GPS, it knows where it-s
close to the mall and when it approches the mall it is able to talk to the
computer at the mall handling the parking lot and ask for a parking spot. When
comming in a mall, I need a parking spot. The mall computer handeling the
parking lot has informations of course on the parking lot what's taken and
what's available, ut it also knows about the weather, it knows about the city,
it knows about what time it is, it knows that it's about to get a rush hour,
And it knows also that in that specific city, the north portion of the city get
really bad when it's rush hour and it's about to rain. So the computer picks up
a free parking spot toward the south side of that mall to make it easyer for
you to leave the mall. So the computer get's that information through your gps
and now you can safefully navigate to what is currently at that specific
moement, the best parking spot in the mall that's available to you. This is the
IOE, becaus eif you think about it, you placed the call to an other person,
wich is an interaction between two people : People to people. Because of that,
you entered an address into you GPS in your car, this is an interaction between
a person and a machine, right it's a people to machine type of interaction. As
the mall computer was making a call of the best parking spot for you, it needed
to rely on a bunch of data on the weather, on the city itself, on the parking
spot that were actually open for use. So that's the data, right? You're using
the data to do that. And this is all possible because it relies on
comunications protocols and applications and all kinds of structures details
that are going on the background. That's what we call the process. So this is
the long answers, I used kind of an exemple, but that's the IOE. That's exactly
a way to interact to connect people, things processus and data.

Sounds awefully complex, sounds complex, sounds like there is a lot of
interactions, there is a lot of things going on. it makes me wonder, I mean,
part of value of the internet right now is just it's the ubiquity of it. And so
It kind of make me wonder as we talk about the internet of Everithing, while
you, Rodrigo, you're really lining out kind of , you know , the opportunity or
the potential of it, you know, I find myself wondering, you know, how big of a
deal is it  really ? You know bob inside of the things that you've been
researching, the things that you enderstand, you know, what can you land in an
answer to that question of how big of a deal is the internet of Everithing ?

Well, I my humble opinion, it's a mass of big deal, you knwo when we think of
the internet of everything, I think right now, we're at the very tip of an
iceberg or at like, the beginning of an avalanche. And I think, back to the
early 90's when I remember seeing on the news they where talking about this
thing called the internet and something called the world wide  web and you know
, and we'd be able to communicate with people around the world and easily and
such and I remember at the time thinking "Waw ! this is gonna really cool but
how big is it going to get ?", And you know, within a matter of years, no five
year later, ten years later, like the internet has now become something that we
all use and think as something we should have available to us. The UN say that
the internet is now something that it's a vital right for humans to have. ANd
you know, consider as well like cellphones or phones 30 the years ago you
just talked to people and 15 years ago cellphones you could text. But take what
your smartphone can do now. You know, it's, it can connect all kinds of things,
you can research all kind of things, it connect to your car, it connect to
like, at home I have a thermostat where it's controlled, I can control it with
my phone. It's all connected ! Companies use , you know use the, manage their
energy more efficiently as well, like, ?helium? ventilation systems in buildings
before ?all pneumatic? . But now it's all automated and connected to the
networks, so a company can adjust, you know, temperatur more efficiently, they
can close light more efficiently and so on so forth

Well I recognise what you are talking about, I mean like lot of things
beeing connected. A question I find myself asking as the release the internet of
Everithing, you know, while i've recogniezed the value and the savings that I
have personnaly benefited from the internet in the past phases of the internet.
You know as I think of the internet of Everything, i'm looking for where dos it
add value to my life, how does it improve my life, our lives, everybody's
lives. Bernadette, I am wondering if you know kind of based of the things that
you've been researching as well and conducting analysis against. Where are you
finding that the internet of everything adds value ?
