Hello, this is Jimmy Creech from Cisco Systems and you listening to the fith in
a series of podcast
introducing the Internet of everything. This podcast series is a companion to
the Cisco Networking
Academy's introduction to the IOE course. And today joining me as with previous
episodes is Rodrigo Floriano, Bernadette O'Brian, Dane Righetti and Bob Fishon.

in previous episodes we talked about what the IOE is, how the IOE works, what its
benefit to society is and what are the security and privacy issues that we
should anticipate with the IOE. And today we are going to talk about what is the
relationship between IOE and big data.

the relationship between the IOE and big
data is with the Internet of everything we have all of these connections that
are happening, all of these, first of all, things that are coming online, so
billions of devices that are gonna be coming online. And we have all of these
connections machine to machine, machine to people and people to people
connections that are happening and all of these connections are producing tons
of data and so that's really the/ the relationship is that we're producing
all this data because we have all of these interconnections and that's between
things, that's between processes, that's between people. And there's really two
factors to this, there's the data reporting and/ which is the what and data
analysis which is the why. Basically we want to collect data, manage that data
and evaluate that data. So today we're taking in data like never before, there's
tons of data being collected or captured and we're producing more data in a week
that was produced in a year. So...

You know, Dane ?

Mmhmmh

You, know, you talk about/ we've created more data in a
week and we've created in a year and I remember/ just recently I saw a complementary
metric describing 90% of the data that we have right now has been created in
the last two years alone, which means, you know, all the years preceding the
last two years makes up only 10% of the data that we have. But I think that
?that's a tale? as to the exponential growth of data that, you know, every two years another
90% on top of that. So yeah it's huge the we have.

You know, we are measuring more now, we have more sensors, have  more things
looking at the events and measuring data and capturing and analysing it.

Yeah, those numbers are just
incredible, they're astonishing at how much. And, so, where's all this data
coming from ?
Well it's coming from, let's say, sensors, devices, mobile devices with embedded
firmware with monitoring systems but also the data is coming from people
through social networks, people online rating things, online rating system,
comments and systems such as ad tracking, cookies, systems that produce
reports,
all kinds of things. So, this date is coming in and this data has a lot of value
if it can be acted upon immediately, if we can analyze this data and do
real-time analysis and action. As a result of the fact that we have the
technology today to do it through virtualization and cloud computing and things on
that, so that brings in the topic of data in motion. Companies are tracking what
we do, the sites that we visit, the things that we buy, the fact that we
rate stuff, you know, today, you know, when I want to go to a restaurant I check yelp
I like to see what other people have done it like to see how other people have
rated things.

So this explains to me like why/, you know, like the other night I
was looking for a new mountain bike that I'd like to purchase in the spring and
then, you know, recently I'm looking at stock prices and right there is this wonderful
little advertisement showing me the bike that I want and I was looking to
buying
just constantly probing me, saying "Hey, you want to look at this again ? You want to
buy it ?"

Yeah, looks like you were close on this one, you want to give it another
chance ?

Absolutely

Hey Dans, just for the folks out there who are  actually listening to others
and don't really know much about what's a web browser, a cookie, would you
give them like a short explanation of cookies ?

Cookies is an interesting topic
because a lot of people like to turn those off because they're fearful
that they're being tracked or that cookies could lead to a virus. Cookies is
just a little bit of text that is created on your computer when you visit
the site and it's not a program so it's not a virus, it's just a little bit
of text that lets the company know that you've been to the site before. And
that text, that text file contains things like maybe your user settings, the
types of the things that you like to do when you're on that site, so that when
you revisit that site it gives information to the site regarding your
preferences.

I see so, a simple example would be when I go back to the side and it said welcome
back Roderigo, I means, I've never signed in, they know that's me because of a cookie
probably.

Yeah, absolutely, that's a good example. But the fact that these companies
are able to get that information and they know what we like, they know
what were doing. And the ideas that they can give us better service and better
targeted service and, you know, advertisement is another great example. So, the
advertisement industry was completely changed by the online\ by online
webpages and websites and advertising used to be ads that were not related to the
content on the page in print, so when you looked at a printed magazine and you
look at advertisements they were not related to whatever the content is. But the
exact opposite is what we have on websites, if you're on a website you're gonna see
related ad content and that's a complete flip in the whole model of
advertising, so it's very interesting.

So if you bring us back to the data
reporting and the data analysis that you were talking about a moment ago. You
know, an example of
the data reporting and giving me the what(s) that would be like, you knwo, somewhere
somebody has collected the information that Jeremy was looking at a mountain
bike and a report would be, you know, they give it to some sales executive or
whatever and says "Hey, this individual has been looking at these mountain
bikes". But
they don't necessarily do anything at the moment with that, but then when you
add this data analysis component these ?wise?, it's that the
piece that's making it so that, as I am looking around on other sites then they
know to create this ad custom for me that says "Hey, there's this mountain
bike". Is
is that making the connection there ?

Yes I think you can make the connection with
that, the curriculum talks about different types of analytics: descriptive
analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. And descriptive
analytics is the historical data, so historical data on what you've bought and
who's bought this and this is what was bought last year and this is what's
being bought this year. But predictive analytics might show a new trend in what
people are buying today and where things are going. And so then, they can then
use prescriptive analytics to run a simulation on, let's say, this could be more
relevant in industries or in organizations that deal with public safety or
with weather or something like that. They could look at a model or simile model
say we need to do this because this is what's coming based on our data analysis
and based on the trends.

So an other example of this would be, let's take
weather for example just to help me understand this. So an example of the data
reporting component is just a historical record of/ this is what happened with
the weather. But the data analysis that comes in and starts to kind of look at
the trends, the correlations of, you know, cause-and-effect and so as new
things start to happen/ and that's the descriptive component, right ? The
reporting piece tells me this is what happened but the descriptive piece looks
it that thing in a much broader context and greater breadth with the trend and
analysis and the correlation analysis and says okay because of these things
that were happening inside of the environment for the atmospher this is why
that event happened that was reported ?on?. And then if I'm understanding
this right, then I can create a/ ,as you talk about, predictive, I can create a
predictive model that is then able to take into account the variables that
are present and determine if a storm is going to happen again. And then the
prescriptive piece is then, you know, based off of that these are the things that
should happen to mitigate the impact or the effects of that storm. So, you
know,
if things like road closures, warnings, you know, sending out emergency
broadcasts, what have you that just/ and that brings a full circle. What
are some of the things we can do with analytics and big data in addition to the
weather example, what's some of the other stuff that we can do ?

So I think of
the example of curring disease when I think about all of this data that we
have available to us. In fact, you know, you wonder, the big question is can big data
cure cancer and cure disease, help us cure diseases. So researchers are capturing
huge amounts of data on as many cancer patients as possible and they're analyzing and
sequencing the genomes of these tumors in depth. This is allowing the
researchers to create more targeted therapies for a particular tumor. They're also
using this data to predict the possibility of people developing particular
cancers and therefore being able to preemptively treat those cancers. The
challege
in this research has been enormous amounts of data produced when
sequencing the genomes of tens of thousands of tumors. But some British
researchers have taken a step toward solving this by creating a database of all
this information that has as a such feature that allows cross referencing
the results from across the different fields of cancer research. Definitely I'm
sure we can predict that we're going to see some real developments in the fight
against cancer.

That's amazing ! Before we were able to make these, like broad,
generalizations alright ? You know, we see this huge population and within this
population there is this large majority that has, you know, this symptom
or has cancer. And another large commonality with this population is, you know,
some other thing that's a part of their environment, that's a detriment,
that's, you know,
that's potentially causing it. So they make this huge general connections but now
with the amount of data they we're able to get it sounds like the
correlations that we're able to do with that and now were able to get much much
more detail and is not like making these broad stereotype in general
statements,
but we're able to get down to like, you know, at the individual level these are the
things pertinent to you, the variables that exist around you that are causing
this issue to come up. Is that capturing it ?

That's exactly right and in addition, they're no
going to just be treating the cancer, but they're going to be treating that
particular cancer in you. So it's actually developing a medicine that will be
almost specialized to you as an individual. It's very amazing !

Another area where
real-time data and analysis is very saving lives is a city in the North of the
United States has implemented a routing and vehicle location system for their
ambulance service. This has improved response rates to less than six minutes
which is compared with the national standard of eight minutes and 59 seconds, so
this has immediately saved lives. The vehicles are outfitted with sensors and
GPS feeding back, you know, real-time information about their location etc. back to
the central calling station.

It's just a really amazing and (that's) hard to wrap my head
around the amount of data we are talking about here.

Consider that organizations just
don't have business data as a source of information anymore. There's all that
environmental stuff for example sensors, video cameras, RFID tags and then
there is also the
social media data that we can get from customer feedback online, forms and
Facebook. Now, all of these sources interact with the four pillars of the IOE
and this interaction even generates additional data and eventually this becomes
big data. So when does data become big data ? Well big data is distinguished
usually by volumes, so how much there is, so when we refer to  big data we're
talking about
very large data sets. Some definitions have it at 100 TB of information is
considered to be big data - or bigger -. For example banks, governments, airports they
generate big data. Another distinguishing feature of big data is how it's
processed, so what we mean here is which types of analytic tools are using to
extrapolate the information. Now, the sheer volume of big data is difficult for
traditional relational database systems like SQL Oracle to process and
extrapolate information. But big data requires a more powerful analytic
tools and we've mentionned these already like, we mentioned Adobe NoSQL map
reduce and such. So again big data is distinguished between how, you know, how big it
is and what tools ?you're? using. And then, we describe data using something called
a 3V's and that's Variety Volume and Velocity. So variety describes the type of
data and there's all kinds of big data there is text, binary data like Word
documents,
PDF, spreadsheet, database files and such there's multimedia documents like
audio,
photos and videos and these are either structured or unstructured, so that's
the variety. The volume is basically the amount of data that's being stored,
analyzed and
transported so, you know, in order to understand or appreciate volume we almost
need to go back to what a bit is and, you know, and I'm sure most of our
listeners know what a kilobyte and the megabyte and a gigabyte and such is and
then get the terabytes and, you know, most new computer today would have like a terabyte
drive or 2 TB drive and such, but when we talk about big data we're going beyond
that, so we're going from terabytes which is 10 to the power of 12 to a petabyte
and even to an exabyte and down the roads zettabyte, so we're going from 10 to the
power of 12 to a zettabyte that's 10 to the power of 21. And, you know, just for
example, like within the last decade the volume of data taht was produced in the year
is not produced in a week so that's 20 EB of data produced per week. And this
data continues to grow exponentially as more more of the unconnected becomes
connected.

If you're listening to us now and you're thinking that this amount
of data is way too much, nobody's never gonna need that, just remember the not
too long ago we thought that one of those little floppy disks they would be
enough and that's all what I mean right ? You could have had all your
applications running on one floppy disk and
you were happy, it was just what 15, 20 years ago and it's not even/ you know, so
before you say that this is too much data we never gonna need that, just think
about that little.

Yeah and consider the amount of hard drives we're gonna need to store
all this information.

Right, right.

So that was Variety and Volume, that was the 2V's the third V
is velocity and that's the rate at which data is moving so, you know, we've already
mentioned that as the unconnected becomes connected more data is gonna be generated
and were producing 20 EB exabytes of data per week, but this data is growing
exponentially. So just to put things into perspective linear growth is when
something increases in a predictable manner so for example you get a 1% pay
increase per year, it's predictable. Exponentially this is where it's a lot more
dramatic than linear growth so that would be if you happen to get the job of your
dream and you got a pay raise doubled every year, so for example you get 1%
the first year 2% the next year 4% 8% and in seven years you can
retire. So we do care about exponential growth because big data is
exponential. So for example a Cisco visual networking Index forecast that data
growth by 2018, that the global Internet traffic will be equivalent to that
of 64 times the volume that we had back in 2005, so that's not just, you know,
it's
increasing by a certain percentage, it's increasing exponentially. So I hope
that answer your question.

Bob, I got another question, I'm sorry Jeremy to
interrupt, but you do mention a few V's, I actually have heard of other V's
other than those, do you know anything about those V's, more V's, people like
V's I guess.

Yeah, well, there is a few of them, actually there's three other V's
that I know of, there's data Value and that's how valuable the information generated
is and, you know, we mentioned earlier real-time data on its own is not especially
valuable but real-time data with real-time analysis is very valuable so that's
one of the V's. Data Virtualization, that refers to where is it located in and,
you know, consider a data as all over the place, we have some in spreadsheets, we
have some in databases and all over the place and Bernadette was mentioned the
cancer research and how it's able to to pull all this information together and
that's usually done using virtualization technologies. And the last one is data
Veracity and that's when I'm gonna talk a little bit more about because it's how
truthful or reliable is the information, now consider that on the Internet for
the most part you can trust the information that you're reading so a map of the
country or a company website talking about a product and such, to some degree
you know it's gonna be accurate, but there's also inaccurate
information out there, so some information could be dated or unconsciously
incorrect or malicious people can be making up things and it could go viral
Dane mentioned, you know, checking yelp before you go to a restaurant, how accurate
is that information ? How do you know they really went to the restaurant ? So,
ou know,
social media is inherently uncertain, you know, Jackie Chan, Jon Bon Jovi and Lady
Gaga are not dead there are, you know, alive and still singing so don't believe
everything you hear on the net. You know, so, from an organizational standpoint
now,
so how do you make sure about veracity ? Well they have to follow
basically a philosophy of trust but verify, so you do trust the information
that's
there but you always verify before you act on it and some companies are even
going as far as giving data veracity scores an ranking for specific sets of
data and that will help make, you know, better decisions and avoid making bad
decisions.

Something you mentioned Bob is/ you mentioned data virtualization and that
in particular kind of peaks my interest because I think that is a critical enabler as
we talk about data analysis moving forward in the context of big data
traditionally it's/ we've got a lot of different transactions that are taking place
that are all kind of have their own data repository and in those data
repositories will then be kind of groomed and then uploaded to a data warehouse
and the data warehouse serves as kind of the central consolidation point for
this.
And sometimes, you know, like they'll take a data warehouse and carve that up into
data markets that can then serve specific needs of a particular function, so
the data market would take a piece of the data warehouse to conduct an analysis on
it for other purposes of financial results or for the purposes of sales
forecasting, but all of that takes a lot of time and there's a lot of movement
of that data, we're talking about lots of data with overnight uploads or, you
know,
every week incremental uploads are, you know, holistic uploads. But when we talk about data
virtualization, data virtualization is an enabler that is able to take a
snapshot of all the data that it needs from a real-time perspective to be able
to facilitate the predictive and the prescriptive elements of how to
take action on real-time data that's happening right now.

Yeah and it does that without
changing the original data, like ??? when it does/ it takes a
snapshot right ? It takes a snapshot and manipulates it, but the original data still
where it was, so you get some layer of protection there.

Right, the computing infrastructure
that's necessary to support that is something that's definitely
growing as we talk about cloud infrastructures, network infrastructures that are
able to acount for that volume of data and the ability to do real-time
analysis on that data.

Yeah, so for example we had talked in a previous podcast
about the Cisco application centric infrastructure, Cisco ACI which is part of
that whole software defined networking of virtualizing the data center and
such,
well it's built to do that, it's built to be able to support in a very/ it's
called a two-tier topology of spine and leaf and it's built to be able to
retrieve that information from any location and the data virtualization is
basically using software like Hadoop and Hadoop file system which goes out
maps everything from does matter if it's a spreadsheet or if it's an SQL
database or if it's real-time data coming in and puts it into like one
platform that can extrapolate the information from it. And that's where like the SQL
databases on it's own, like SQL and Oracle they were able to basically get the
information from their database, you know, for it to be able to pull information
from all these other sources that's where they're not really built for that and
that's where data virtualization comes.

For our listeners as we talk about
MapReduce and Hadoop, I don't know that we've expended on that in past
podcasts, but, you know, we talk about these very large data repositories and then you
want to conduct analysis to it but that's a lot of numbercrunching that
requires a lot of compute power and so MapReduce, what that is, is that
it takes that large repository and breaks out into smaller pieces that
different computations can be ran again, so it's distributed computing it
takes a large volume of data, it distributes the data all across a large
number of distributed computing platforms so that it's almost parallel
processing, it allows a lot of different devices to be able to manage the analysis
of a large volume set much much more quickly and that's MapReduce but when
they/ the creators of map reduce they open sourced that on the Apache platform and
it was named Haddop.

And when we're talking about real-time analysis, the first
thing that comes to mind is the concept of the data in motion, right ? The
data in motion and data at rest, the two terms that you're gonna
hear a lot when dealing with this data analysis and dealing with IoE
and the big data. And in a way really, the data in motion is when you're
trying/ when you you're analyzing running some sort of a processing
against the data as you capture it. So that would be, you know, (what) we are talking
about and how you can, how a company can see if a specific product they have is
selling a lot right now or not selling. I mean, having information about
that specific sale at the moment it's happening, this is data in motion, you're
analyzing everything as it happens, in the opposition of data at rest
which would be more towards the example that was given in this conversation a
little earlier when you want to see/ you want to know about what happened in
the past with the weather, if it was cold at this time of the year for the last 20
years, 25 years, so this kind of analysis is really done by data that's already
stored. So this would be/ it's called the data at rest,
it's very interesting when you're talking about the data in motion because while
there is a few benefits, for example I don't have to worry about sending this
data to a data center, I don't have to worry about the network structure to
support all this data because I'm not/ I don't really care about sending, I want
to analyze it right away, as soon as possible, I also don't have to worry about
any place to store this data 'cause I don't really care about storing what I
want to know is what's happening right now. This may look like a benefit
but there is a downside which is I have to have now the ability to process this
data at the source, so if we're talking about sensors, the sensors now have to be a
little more powerful or powerful enough to be able to process the data as they
are being capture, as this data is being captured. So it's really, it's/ there
is no
brass when you're talking about data in motion and  data at rest, it's really the application
that you're going to put/ these two terms you're gonna, you know, your application is
going to say which one, which type of data you're gonna be looking at. I can
give you, guys, an
example, Jeremy I know you love examples.

I do.

So if we are, I mean,this/ the example
of the data brass I guess it was pretty clear we were talking about earlier,
right ? But the weather, it's a very good example, when you want to know/ when I
have an idea what's going to be the weather in a month from now, doesn't matter
where you are, if you know, if you're capturing if you're analyzing how was the
weather in that place at that moment in the last 20, 25 years you should have a
pretty good idea what the weather's going to be like in a month from now in
that location, even though it may not be exactly the same temperature rainy or
sunny, but you'll have a very good idea what's going to happen because you've been
analyzing this data that has been stored and capture over the years, right?
But the data in motion/ I'm gonna give another example which is a something that is happening
now and people are using a lot, I mean talking about it a lot, it's the
driverless car, right?
A car that doesn't need any human beings to be guiding the car, to be
controlling the car. The car is driving itself, if I was to write a piece of
software to put in the car, to run in the car, it doesn't matter if, you know,
the road/ how were those roads, the temperature of the road 20 years ago
or the last year whatever, what I need to know is there is a car in front of me
should I stop or should I keep moving and I need to know that right then, right
on the spot, because if it takes me another second to make the decision I could
be into an accident. So in that kind of situation what I really need is data in
motion, I need to know what's happening right now to be able to use the
data to turn that data into information and make an educated decision about what
path to take.

As I listen to us talk about this, we talked about data before and
we talk about big data now. And it seems like there's not really clear
delineation, you know,
when have I moved from data to big data, to me it's almost like we're
describing an evolution, it's almost like the Renaissance, if you will, it's like
we are now in the era of big data and so we need to be cognizant of that and to
create an infrastructure that is able to take advantage of that and to invent
processes that are able to leverage it. So I guess my question now is what's
next ? Where we go from here ?

I think that what is gonna happen is we're gonna see an
explosion of innovative ideas around the Internet of everything. And one of
the ways that we get ?to? put those out there is, you know, if I have a great idea for an
innovative solution, I need to put together a working model, and we call that
working model of prototype. You know, in order to create that prototype, you have to have
design skills, electrical skills, mechanical, physical skills to build this
thing programming skills as well. The trouble is, you know, we're not expert in all of
those things, so we can do a few things, we can collaborate with others and of
course you can get help online, there are a ton of great resources pointed out in the
course that can help you create your prototype.

Bernadette, I mean, as you describe
prototyping, I mean, it's this really interesting confluence or convergence of lots of
different knowledge, you mentioned electrical skills mechanical skills
programming skills and networking skills, you know, once you get this
object created that has these actuators that can do these things and these
sensors that can help it understand its environment and the variables around it
then you get this programming that's able to connect what the sensors sense to what
the actuators need to do and then, you know, to plug it in to the Internet of everything
and to make it work and in the larger network of things there's the others this
networking aspect that goes into it, how do I connect this.

It's hard to know
also completely where everything is going to go because our lives are gonna be
changed by the increase amount of information that is
tracking us or that's providing information. So I think that we don't
really know exactly how everything's gonna change. And definitely, to pick up
on Rod's points, not necessarily gonna be all for the good.

It emphasizes the
responsibility to think about how to do it safely, how to do it securely and how
to, you know, maintain people's privacy.

So we talked about some of the skills that are
needed, you know, like design skills, electrical skills, physical and
mechanical skills,
programming skills, networking skills and obviously, I mean, as I hear
about this, as we talk about things, you know, programming is absolutely critical to
the IOE. You know, where do I go to gain these skills ?

There's a lot of resources including
the Cisco networking Academy. Cisco's got lots of new courses coming online like
this one the IOE the Internet of everything courses that students can self
enroll and many of my students didn't even realize that they could do that and
as soon as you point it out they're like "wow I can self enroll on this course and I
could fall on and I can enhance my learning". A lot of people are going online there
so many programming resources to learn about programming to learn about
scripting through the web and we find/ I find that in the college system a lot
of the professors and instructors are utilizing these resources, a lot of people
today utilizing YouTube and alternative platforms to enhance education, students
are becoming more resourceful, we've seen the advent of the con Academy which is
incredible, enormous. I think that there is a lot of online resources that are
available today including the traditional college/university/school systems and
the students are really taking advantage of all of these resources and as well
as you mentioned Arduino's and raspberry pi's and physical computing which is a
huge deal, people are going to be inventing this is a great time for
entrepreneurs and inventors who will gonna be taking advantage of the Internet of
everything and bringing on new devices that will hopefully improve
our environments, improve our businesses.

This isn't stuff that you have to be in a
major urban center for or close to a/ the right school that's doing it that/ you
really do, I mean, check with your local community you might be
surprised at the number of workshops and classes that are actually available,
talk to your local governments, talk to local schools, check with your local
Chamber of Commerce and just go online and look for some expert advice then
there might be people who might be able to direct you locally to get engaged
with this. There's things like the ?maker? spaces, there's things like the tech
shops that are available and these are spaces that have tools like 3-D printers and
laser lathes and all sorts of stuff that, you kow, for small fierce
subscription bases,
you can get access to these tools and it's ideal for the Tinker, you know, you don't
have necessary thousand dollars laying around to purchase these things but, you
know, a few bucks in a month you can get access to this stuff and kind of
playing around with creating your own stuff from a mechanical or physical
perspective as well as an electrical perspective as well as just join the
community, get involved with other people who are doing this and glean from one
another and share ideas and, you know, just get those innovative juices flowing
?the?
kind of prototype something, create some models see what the possibilities
really are.

Yes, so on top of all, Jeremy, all those, you know, amazing
resources you mentioned, there's also something very similar, there is the hacker
spaces, it's very similar to the maker space, you can learn a little bit of
coding, you
learn a little bit of IT in general, right ? How to deal with computers OSs and whatnot
it's a very very good place to check to learn more and to experiment. There's also the
hackaton also very very interesting idea you get together with other people
running through some challenges and, you know, it's just fun, it's just really
really fun stuff and it's gets much much better to learn this kind of technology
when you have other people working together and, you know, being partners and
showing off and in sharing ideas it's really amazing time to
be a learner, I guess I can say.

The other thing is, in the curriculum, the curriculum
highlights these recorded PKZ files from packet tracer that include all of
these sensors and actuators and controllers and so the students who go
through the IOE curriculum are gonna notice that packet tracer has these new
Internet of everything devices within packet tracer.

And for our listeners who may
not know, packet tracer is a simulation tool for creating a network.

For free by the way.

Right and so, with the new version of packet tracer which is not
out yet but is gonna be coming out soon it's gonna have Internet of everything
enabled devices within the packet tracer program, within software so that you
can set up your own simulated models or your own simulated networks that have
that capability built into them so that's really cool and I'm looking forward to
when that comes out.

Yes with the rapid expansion of the Internet of everything
and these 50 billion connections that we're talking about, this is
creating a global shortage of people who are qualified to work on maintain
these networks. And also we've got the implementation of IPv6 happening
globally.
Yeah, we need skilled people to maintain and implement these solutions, we need
people who have these security expertise to secure data and to secure all these
new devices that are being connected to our networks.

Yeah and not only that, we're gonna need
people to write code, we're gonna need people to be able to come up with these new
analyzing models, right ? So people with some knowledge in the math and
especially,
if you're talking about math, especially in statistics, we're gonna need people
in that kind of area as well, people with knowledge on engineering, knowledge
on electronics that's not gonna be if you are into IOE you're not gonna be
unemployed. I guess I can say that much.

Definitely and there's no doubt about it.

Well guys, I have really enjoyed this conversation, the series of
conversations that we've had as we conducted this podcast and today's
conversations talking about the opportunities that are there for us,
what we can do in the future the opportunities for the inventors the
opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs and just in general, just
employment around the IOE I think it's a fascinating time and I'm really excited
and looking forward to things to come. I want to thank all of our panelists Bob Dan
Bernadette and Rodrigo and most importantly I'd like to thank all of our
listeners. Thank for listening to this series on the Internet of everything.
